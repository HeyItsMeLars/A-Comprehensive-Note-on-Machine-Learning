Here is a list of the things that I have added to the repository:
  -Added a bit about covariance and covariance matrices in notation.tex, as well as why this is important. (Starts on line 260)
  -Added KNN section to fundamental algorithm that hadn't been added yet (when I wrote it, may have changed since then)
