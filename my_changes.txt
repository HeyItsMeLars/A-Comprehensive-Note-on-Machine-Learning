Here is a list of the things that I have added to the repository:
  -Added a bit about covariance and covariance matrices in notation.tex, as well as why this is important. (Starts on line 260 on notation.tex)
  -Added KNN section to fundamental algorithm that hadn't been added yet (when I wrote it, may have changed since then) (line 129 fundamental_algo.tex) because I wanted to review
  -Added a bit about gini impurity (since it was mentioned but never explained in detail) and compared it to entropy (line 331 notation.tex)
